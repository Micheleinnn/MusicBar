        bbn$ Born Alexander Gumuchian in Vancouver, he dabbled with piano and
        percussion as a child, but favored swimming over music. That changed
        when he injured his back in high school, dashing his professional
        dreams. He studied college-level kinesiology to gain a better
        understanding of pain, which inspired him to try his hand at music.
        Gumuchian's early songwriting involved the Broke Boy Gang, a local crew
        who performed and recorded together for a brief period before splitting
        up. On his own, he started composing tracks in earnest, uploading them
        online in 2016 as "bbnomula." With a heavy trap influence and clever
        sense of humor, Gumuchian built an underground audience across the
        globe, from the U.S. to China, and soon other rappers came calling for
        collaborations, including Minnesota's Yung Gravy. The pair issued one of
        their first singles, "Run This Shit," in 2017. Later that year, a full
        EP, Baby Gravy, arrived.

        The Black Eyed Peas date back to 1988, when eighth-graders William Adams
        (will.i.am) and Allan Pineda (apl.de.ap) met and began rapping and
        performing together around Los Angeles. The pair signed to Ruthless
        Records (run by Eazy-E) in 1992, catching the attention of Eazy-E
        manager Jerry Heller's nephew. Along with another friend of theirs,
        Dante Santiago, they called their trio Atban Klann (ATBAN: A Tribe
        Beyond a Nation). Will 1X (aka will.i.am), apl.de.ap, Mookie Mook, DJ
        Motiv8 (aka Monroe Walker), and Dante Santiago formed Atban Klann. Their
        debut album, Grass Roots, was never released due to Ruthless Records
        founder Eazy-E's death. After Eazy-E died in 1995, Atban Klann reformed
        and changed their name to Black Eyed Pods, and then Black Eyed Peas.
        Dante Santiago was replaced with rapper, Jaime Gomez (Taboo), and Kim
        Hill a singer which featured on a selected number of their tracks.
        Santiago continued to be a background singer for the group. Unlike the
        "gangsta rap" sounds of Los Angeles-based hip hop acts at the time, the
        trio performed with a live band and adopted a conscious musical and
        appearance style. After being signed to Interscope Records and releasing
        their debut, Behind the Front (1998) the group (and their accompanying
        live band) earned critical acclaim. One of the singles from the album
        was "Joints & Jam", and was featured on the Bulworth soundtrack. Singer
        Sierra Swan joined in 1998, appearing on the 1998 song "Fallin' Up",
        before she left in 2000. Their second album, Bridging the Gap (2000),
        produced the singles "Weekends" featuring Esthero and "Request + Line"
        featuring R&B singer Macy Gray. Hill left the band while producing the
        album, but was still featured on the album tracks for "Hot" and "Tell
        Your Mama Come" as well as in the video for "Weekends".
